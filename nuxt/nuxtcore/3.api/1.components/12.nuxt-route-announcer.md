::important
Component này is available trong Nuxt v3.12+.
::

## Usage

Add `<NuxtRouteAnnouncer/>` trong [`app.vue`](/docs/guide/directory-structure/app) hoặc [`layouts/`](/docs/guide/directory-structure/layouts) để enhance accessibility by informing assistive technologies about page title changes. Điều này ensures rằng navigational changes are announced để users relying trên screen readers.

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
  <NuxtRouteAnnouncer />
  <NuxtLayout>
    <NuxtPage />
  </NuxtLayout>
</template>
```

## Slots

Bạn can pass custom HTML hoặc components through route announcer's default slot.

```vue
  <template>
    <NuxtRouteAnnouncer>
      <template #default="{ message }">
        <p>{{ message }} was loaded.</p>
      </template>
    </NuxtRouteAnnouncer>
  </template>
```

## Props

- `atomic`: Controls if screen readers only announce changes hoặc entire content. Set để true cho full content readouts trên updates, false cho changes only. (default `false`)
- `politeness`: Sets urgency cho screen reader announcements: `off` (disable announcement), `polite` (waits cho silence), hoặc `assertive` (interrupts immediately). (default `polite`)

::callout
Component này is optional. :br
Để achieve full customization, bạn can implement own one based trên [its source code](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/blob/main/packages/nuxt/src/app/components/nuxt-route-announcer.ts).
::

::callout
Bạn can hook into underlying announcer instance using [the `useRouteAnnouncer` composable](/docs/api/composables/use-route-announcer), which allows bạn để set một custom announcement message.
